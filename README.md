# in-situ-neutron-diff

Through the collaboration with Katharine Page at UTK, in situ neutron diffraction data will be collected on multicomponent rare earth (RE) titanate pyrochlores (A2Ti2O7) over a large temperature range (800-2400C). We want to create a ML model that can extract phase transition temperatures from a single measurment. 

## High level goals:

1. One or two papers where we use creative methods to extract signals from in-situ and operando measurements carried out by collaborators, principally Kate Page's group at UTK

## Fall 2024
The Fall will be considered a success of high level goals 1, 2, and 3 are accomplished

1. Visit ORNL and conduct experiment (Nov 17th-20th)
2. Extract scientific insight from the data that they are not able to on their own
3. Write a report on this that can be the basis of a paper
