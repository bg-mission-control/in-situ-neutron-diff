# in-situ-neutron-diff

Through the collaboration with Katharine Page at UTK, in situ neutron diffraction data will be collected on multicomponent rare earth (RE) titanate pyrochlores (A2Ti2O7) over a large temperature range (800-2400C). We want to create a ML model that can extract phase transition temperatures from a single measurment. 

## High level goals:
The Fall will be considered a success of high level goals 1, 2, and 3 are accomplished

1) Visit ORNL and conduct experiment (Nov 17th-20th)
2) Find a way to incorporate ML into their work
3) Determine an ML model

## Team:
- Caden Myers
- Sean Drewry (UTK)
